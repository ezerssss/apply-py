I'm Ezra Magbanua, a Computer Science student from the University of the Philippines, reaching out to inquire about possible internship opportunities in software engineering or technology development roles within your organization.

I'm always interested in working with teams that value clean code, thoughtful design, and practical problem-solving which I try to apply in my own work. Your company seems like a place where I could contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow as a developer.

I have prior internship experience and have worked on several deployed software projects, both individually and as part of a team. My background includes full-stack development for web and mobile applications, using tools like Firebase, GCP, and various modern frameworks. I've worked in fast-paced environments where writing clean, maintainable code and shipping real products mattered.

In addition to development experience, I also have a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. I was a finalist in both Algolympics 2025 and in the National Olympiad in Informatics 2021 (NOI) during high school. Joining such competitions sharpened my ability to think critically and write efficient code.

I've attached my resume for your reference. I'd be thrilled to learn more about your work and explore any opportunities to contribute. Thank you for your time and consideration.
